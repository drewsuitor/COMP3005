/*
Basic node.js server with express-based middleware and SQLite database.
Here rendering is done without templates -that is, the javascript
code builds the web page html tags directly.
This is not good in that the web page struture is not isolated and
easily maintained -but it keeps the code simple for now.

The server allows client to find songs, including their chord progressions, in
its SQLite database. The database provided has chord progressions
of some 1200 popular jazz standards.

This example uses server-side web page rendering that is done directly by the
the javacript routing code.

Here we use a routes module, or file. We put our route handling javascript functions in
a separate module that is "required" by the main app.
This keeps things clean and modularized.

We use the exported route functions in the 'use' and 'get' express
routes below. Typically 'use' calls functions that invoke next() whereas
get and post routes send responses to the client -but these are not enforced rules.

To launch:
node.js and npm must be installed on your computer.

Install the required modules (listed in package.json file) by executing:
>npm install

Run the application by executing:
>node server.js
